## Bespoke _Soundscapes_ for the World's Most _Exquisite Events_

### You don’t just want a vibe. You want _goosebumps_.

Welcome to sound design that _moves_, _mesmerizes_, and _makes your guests stay longer, feel deeper, and remember forever_.

### Why _Sonic Sommelier?_

Most events play music. But have you ever _designed with sound_?

**Sonic Sommelier** works like no one else—merging musical mastery with the precision of experiential design.

We don’t press play. We orchestrate emotion.

### The Psychology of _Sound_

Sound _does more_ than fill a room. It commands mood. Drives energy. Amplifies luxury. Used right, it’s _invisible elegance_. Used _perfectly_? It’s unforgettable.

We handcraft immersive sonic environments that align with your space, your energy, your brand.

Every note. Curated with care.

### Signature Sound for the _Rare Few_

You’re not planning just another event. You’re curating a _moment that matters_. And that demands more than a DJ or a pre-made playlist.

Our clients include:

- Luxury wedding visionaries

- Global brands with taste

- High-net-worth tastemakers

- Cultural curators with elevated sensibilities


We don’t cater to everyone. Just those who _know the difference_.

### Meet Your _Maestro_

**Keanna O’Quinn** isn’t just a sound designer.

She’s a mood architect. A sonic storyteller. A curator of unforgettable atmospheres.

As featured by _The New York Times_, _Harper’s Bazaar_, and _ESSENCE_—she’s the name behind the sound that insiders trust.

Every beat? _Custom_.

Every playlist? _Personal_.

Every guest? _Transformed_.
