# Tomea N' Nem - Luxury Artist Brand Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Design** inspired by Sonic Sommelier's editorial minimalism, adapted for a premium performance artist brand. The aesthetic balances sophisticated restraint with emotional depth - powerful yet warm, artistic yet structured.

## Typography System

**Font Families:**
- **Display/Headings:** Playfair Display or Cormorant Garamond (serif, editorial elegance)
- **Body Text:** Inter or 'Gill Sans' (clean, modern readability)

**Type Scale:**
- Hero Headlines: 4xl-6xl (72-96px desktop), bold weight
- Section Headings: 3xl-4xl (48-60px), semibold
- Subheadings: xl-2xl (24-36px), medium weight
- Body Text: base-lg (16-18px), regular weight
- Small Text/Captions: sm (14px)

**Styling:** High contrast between delicate italic serif headings and clean sans-serif body. Use italic emphasis sparingly for emotional copy.

## Layout System

**Spacing Primitives:** Use Tailwind units of 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32 (p-4, m-8, py-12, etc.)

**Section Padding:** py-20 to py-32 on desktop, py-12 to py-16 on mobile

**Container Widths:**
- Full-width sections: w-full with max-w-7xl inner container
- Text content: max-w-4xl for optimal reading
- Narrow content: max-w-3xl

**Grid System:** 
- Desktop: 2-3 columns for galleries, single column for narrative sections
- Mobile: Always single column, generous spacing

3. **About Section:** Elegant headshot (provided: Headshot_1.jpg or Headshot_3.jpg)
4. **Videos:** Embedded performance videos with thumbnails
5. **Merch:** Product photography from Printful API
6. **Business Branches:** Custom graphics or performance stills for each program

**Image Treatment:** Moody lighting, high contrast, occasional gold/red accent lighting in styling. All images should feel cinematic and premium.

## Buttons & CTAs

**Primary Buttons:**

- Uppercase or small caps lettering
- When on images: frosted glass/blur background effect
- No hover animations on hero buttons

## Animations
Use extremely sparingly - only subtle fade-ins on scroll for section reveals. No distracting effects.

## Visual Accents
- Gold horizontal rules to separate major sections
- Deep red used sparingly for emotional emphasis (select quotes, key CTAs)
- Generous negative space
- Editorial pull quotes in sections with personal testimonials
